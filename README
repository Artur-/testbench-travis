Example on how you can run TestBench tests using Travis.

To setup your own project:
1. Fork this project
2. Open http://travis-ci.org and sign in using your GitHub account
3. Open your profile page
4. If you don't see any repositories, wait a minute or click the "Sync account" button
and wait for synchronization to complete
5. Find the repository in the list and enable builds for it
6. Click the settings icon (cogwheel) beside the switch
7. Add an secure environment variable TESTBENCH_LICENSE containing your TestBench license

Testing the setup
1. Create a commit in a new branch
2. Create a pull request for the branch

Travis should automatically build your project and run the TestBench tests
on PhantomJS. If you modify (break) BasicIT in your commit, Travis should
fail your pull request.

If you want to prevent broken pull requests from being merged, go to the
repository settings -> branches, make master a protected branch and select
"Require status checks to pass before merging" and
"continuous-integration/travis-ci".
